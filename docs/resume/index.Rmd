# Résumé 

I suppose it would be a good idea to write one of these things? I feel mildly confident that I have indeed accomplished things and have a few useful skills, but I seem to have forgotten to list them. A grave omission for anyone with ambitions to remain gainfully employed, I expect.

Edit: Okay *fine*. Here is my scandalously short two-page [academic résumé](./danielle-navarro-academic-resume.pdf). Also, because academic résumés are boring stuffy lists of achievements and not particularly helpful in an industry context, here is a [skills-focused résumé](./danielle-navarro-industry-resume.pdf).
